## WhatToLearn
 
Creating a place where someone can find what they need to learn to succeed in a particular role they would like to obtain

This a project that I'm deciding to begin due to some overwhelming feelings on not knowing what to learn when I am so eager to learn many things. 

If you've ever spent your day looking through job postings for the same position you'll see different companies can approach the same goal any number of ways, and the whirlwind of technical skills and non-technical skills can get jumbled in your mind. I've decided that I want to gather that information all into one place to help others know how to channel their efforts.
